# NeoVim

Watching `The Primegean` convinced me that I needed to at least experiment with
this text editor.

**Note:** at the moment I hate you The Primegean. But, I'll give it a try...

## What do I use the text editor most often for?

- LaTex, Markdown
- C/C++, CMake, Make, Doxygen
- Python
- Matlab

## What do I need?

**My previous text editor of preference was VSCode. Therefore, I want my
experience to be as close to what I'm used to as possible.**

Here is a list of features that I consider indispensable if this is gonna work:

- An autocompletion helper (something like the intellisense)

- A way to jump to function/variable definition and back to where I was

- A way to debug my code

- A way to navigate through my files (like the vertical left toolbar)

- A way to quickly access the console to compile and run my code

- Black background and nice color scheme

- Be able to drag a whole line or several lines up and down (alt+Up or alt+Down)

- Multiple cursors (Ctrl+Shift+Up or Ctrl+Shift+Down)

- Cut (Ctrl+x), copy (Ctrl+c), paste (Ctrl+v)

- undo (Ctrl+z), redo (Ctrl+Shift+z)

- Select text (Shift+Arrows) (Shift+Ctrl+Arrows)


## Configuration

I'm gonna be using `vim-plug` as my pluggin manager.
